            <p>We deal in computers, electronics, and technology. If you have
            an interest in anything computer related you can find like-minded
            individuals here which you can teach and learn with.</p>

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>If you have any interest in computers we offer a great way to
            meet, talk, learn, and teach other WMU students and alumni. Not
            everyone is interested in talking about technology, but at the
            CCoWMU you will always have an attentive audience.</p>

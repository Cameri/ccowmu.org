The main site for the Computer Club of Western Michigan University (CCoWMU).

## Workflow ##

Please work in a topic branch and open pull requests, even if you are a
contributor and merge your own PR.

## Deploying ##

The site is only deployed from the master branch, so feel free to push any
other topic branches freely. Once a commit is merged into master it should show
up on the site soon thereafter.
